The set of classes of interest correspond to \textit{car, truck, bus, combi, motorcycle, bike, mototaxi} and \textit{pedestrian}, see Fig. \ref{fig:clases}. It is worth mentioning that there are three particular classes: cars correspond to sedan or hatchback type vehicles; \textit{mototaxi} are vehicles from the Yucatan region, Mexico; and trucks represent the class with the most varied vehicles, as they include vans with open cabins, with closed cabins or cargo boxes, tortons, and trailers.
